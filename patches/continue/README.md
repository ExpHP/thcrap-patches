# `continue` patch

Makes continues in TH10-12 work like the rest of the series.

## Known issues

* For technical reasons, game over music is disabled.
* You have unlimited continues. (I didn't see any reason to cap them).  The "continue count" (last digit of your score) still caps at 9 for obvious reasons.
* You're still allowed to save replays after a continue.  I'm not sure what happens if you do, nor do I particularly care.  Maybe I'll add a check to prevent this later.
